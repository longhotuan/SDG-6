Climate change projections foresee an increase in water stress problems in many tourist resorts. Tourist islands are particularly challenged due to their geographical isolation and the limited options for enhancing supply. Despite the significance of the problem, the understanding of the tourism and water–stress complex remains under-researched. In this article, we aim at a novel, integrated and spatiotemporally dynamic conceptualization of tourist islands’ vulnerability to water stress. To do this, we begin by presenting the “Water-Tourism Social-Ecological Systems framework” based on literature on water and tourism, social-ecological systems, adaptation, vulnerability, resilience, and island studies. We then apply this framework to investigate the so far underexplored vulnerability to water stress of the island of Rhodes (Greece). Results from in-depth interviews with key stakeholders along with secondary sources provide insights into the Rhodes Water-Tourism SES dynamics. Our analysis provides an interdisciplinary and multidimensional lens to the water-stress and -tourism complex. It enriches the literature of tourism and water and gives the opportunity to open up the scope of solutions that are being discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; Greece; islands; Rhodes; social-ecological systems; tourism; Water","climate change; conceptual framework; integrated approach; interdisciplinary approach; tourism; tourist destination; vulnerability; water use; Greece; Rhodes [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean",,,,,,,,,,"Arnell, N., Delaney, E., Adapting to climate change: Public water supply in England and Wales (2006) Climatic Change, 78 (2), pp. 227-254; Bakema, M., Parra, C., McCann, P., Analyzing the social lead-up to a human-induced disaster: The gas extraction-earthquake nexus in Groningen, The Netherlands (2018) Sustainability, 10 (10), p. 3621; Barberán, R., Egea, P., Gracia-de-Rentería, P., Salvador, M., Evaluation of water saving measures in hotels: A Spanish case study (2013) International Journal of Hospitality Management, 34, pp. 181-191; Becken, S., Hay, J.E., (2007) Tourism and climate change: Risks and opportunities., , Clevedon, Somerset: Channel View Publications; Bennett, N.J., Blythe, J., Tyler, S., Ban, N., Communities and change in the Anthropocene: Understanding social-ecological vulnerability and planning adaptations to multiple interacting exposures (2016) Regional Environmental Change, 16 (4), pp. 907-926; Birkmann, J., Buckle, P., Jaeger, J., Pelling, M., Setiadi, N., Garschagen, M., Kropp, J., Extreme events and disasters: A window of opportunity for change?

Irrigation application efficiency (AE) at nine experimental fields showed a wide range, from 20 to 80%, but was mostly between 40 and 60%. Irrigation water-use efficiency (IWUE) varied from 1.9 to 7.2 kg m−3 for onion and 0.9 to 1.2 kg m−3 for maize. The lined and earthen canal conveyance losses in Bebeks were 0.037 and 0.047 l s−1 m−1, whereas in Shina they were 0.033 and 0.044 l s−1 m−1, respectively. The overall consumed ratio (OCR) of water was 0.58 for Bebeks and varied from 0.73 to 1.2 in Shina. Both schemes are performing below the standard based on technical performance indicators. Irrigation water user associations (WUAs) were not implemented, but irrigation committees (ICs), composed of local political leaders, are managing both schemes. Canal and reservoir sedimentation from erosion of upstream catchment areas during the rainy season was the major problem. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Irrigation; performance indicators; social network; water-use efficiency","canal; erosion; irrigation; performance assessment; sedimentation; social network; water use efficiency; Ethiopia; Lake Tana Basin; Allium cepa; Zea mays",,,,,"WIZ_2013070213768

The French local water management plans (SAGE) developed an integrated approach that relies on a balance between bottom-up and top-down governance. The aim of this article is to question the actual role of the local basin authorities and ask whether they are central in water governance. The Social Network Analysis of the Thau basin shows that the key actors of the SAGE, namely the Rhone-Mediterranean-Corsica Water Agency, the local water agency and the local water commission, are the most powerful actors in the management of the river basin and play a crucial brokerage role in climate change adaptation.

However, despite a positive but rather ideological evolution, the country is still facing several water challenges in practice. Water governance is extremely complex due to intricate social structures, important spatial and temporal differences in the availability of water resources, ecological fragility, and weak institutions. A Transdisciplinary Learning Community approach has been adopted by the Universidad Católica Boliviana to take into account the complexity of the water problems caused by social, hydrological, and ecological system imbalances. In this approach, researchers and non-academic actors work closely together to integrate different ways of conceiving, using, valuing, and deciding on water issues. The approach aims at co-creating resilient solutions by recovering and restoring not only the ecological system, but also the social system in which all actors are aware of their role and responsibility.

A widespread intervention is the construction of agro-pastoral dams and irrigation schemes in traditionally pastoral communities that face a drying climate. Taking the Maji Moto Maasai community in southern Kenya as a case study, this article demonstrates that water access inequality can lead to a breakdown of pre-existing social capital and former pastoral cooperative structures within a community. When such interventions trigger new water uses, such as farming in former pastoral landscapes, there are no traditional customary institutional structures in place to manage the new water resource. The resulting easily corruptible local water management institutions are a main consolidator of water access inequalities for intervention beneficiaries, where socio-economic standing often determines benefits from interventions. Ultimately, technological adaptation interventions such as agro-pastoral dams may result in tensions and a high fragmentation of adaptive capacity within target communities. © 2018 by the authors.","Adaptation intervention; Adaptive capacity; Agro-pastoralism; Conflict; Cooperation; Kenya; Social capital; Water access","accessibility; adaptive management; agricultural cooperative; conflict management; equity; pastoralism; social capital; water management; water resource; water supply; Kenya",,,,,"European Research Council

The projects aimed at improving the living conditions of various ethnic minorities in these areas. We focused on poverty alleviation, water management, and nature conservation. In all cases, there was a close collaboration between Vietnamese and Belgian researchers. The participation of the local population was an important ambition in the research. In this paper, we describe the three projects and analyze the relationships among the Belgian and Vietnamese researchers on the one hand, and between the researchers, the authorities, and the local population on the other hand. Furthermore, we examine the opportunities and obstacles to interdisciplinary and intercultural cooperation, with the help of critical theories on participation and decolonization. The three consecutive research projects can be considered as intensive learning processes for the researchers, the local communities, and the authorities.

As a coping mechanism, deprived communities in Nairobi's large informal settlements are increasingly devising new strategies, technologies, institutional frameworks and servicing models to satisfy their water needs, in the face of neglect by the state, private sector and conventional market suppliers. Through the lens of Alternative Model of Local Innovation, this paper interrogates the viability of community-led infrastructure provision exemplified by the bio-centre model as an alternative servicing model that also claims to promote bottom-linked governance and inclusive urban development policies.

More than ever, public authorities that define water tariffs face the challenge of reconciling environmental and cost recovery objectives with equity and financial accessibility for all. Indicators of water affordability can be helpful in this regard. Conventional affordability indicators often rely on the actual amount that households spend on water use. In contrast, we propose a needs-based indicator that measures the risk of being unable to afford the amount of water necessary to fulfill essential needs, i.e. needs that should be fulfilled for adequate participation in society. In this paper we set forth the methodological choices inherent to constructing a needs-based affordability indicator. Using a micro-dataset on households in Flanders (Belgium), we compare its results with the outcomes of a more common actual expenses-indicator. The paper illustrates how the constructed needs-based indicator can complement existing affordability indicators, and its capacity to reveal important risk groups. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adequate social participation; Affordability indicator; Basic needs; Reference budgets; Water affordability","basic needs; data set; developing world; social participation; water availability; water use; Belgium; Flanders; water; Belgium; cost; economics; family size; water supply; Belgium; Costs and Cost Analysis; Family Characteristics; Water; Water Supply",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water",,,,"We thank Ellen Wailly for her helpful advice and Pascale Geulleaume for her attentive examination of the final text.

It advocates for actions both for sustainable cities, the largest interconnected and only human ecosystem, and for the global ocean that is the largest physical ecosystem. Cutting-edge concepts and actions are presented by and for cities and oceans, following the global engagements during the years 2015-2017. In the era of global geopolitics, cities offer major democratic spaces between the micro-regulations of the local communities and the governance of the global commons. The role of education, trust, and citizen empowerment cannot be stressed enough. This book offers an evidence-based, holistic and integrated view of key urban and ocean sustainability issues at the horizon of 2030 and of 2050. The chapters cover the most prominent issues at the heart of the matter, and highlight systemic multi-stakeholder eco-responses towards sustainability with economic, social, environmental dimensions, including political and cultural aspects. This book offers a full exploration of cities and seas with an emphasis on vigorous paradigm shifts, redesigning human systems, and reconciling them with nature. Building on robust evidence, and transformational cases, it provides structured advice for world leaders, stakeholders and scholars. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Blue/green growth; Coastal and marine biodiversity; Corporate ocean responsibility; Environmental risks and opportunities; Food water energy; Integrated economic social and environmental development; Resilience; Role of science and innovation; Urban marine and coastal sustainability",,,,,,,,,,,"Sustainable cities index 2016 (2016) Putting people at the heart of city sustainability, , Amsterdam; Attali, J., (2016) Vivement après demain, , Fayard, Paris; Attali, J., (2017) Histoire des Mers, , Fayard, Paris; (2015) Powering climate action: Cities as global changemakers, , New York; (2016) Deadline 2020: How cities will get the job done, , New York; (2017) Le Monde vers 2050, , Flammarion, Paris; (2015) One New York.

Multi-party collaboration is increasingly vital at both the strategy development and implementation levels. Multi-party collaboration involves a process of joint decision-making among key stakeholders in a problem domain directed towards the future of that domain. However, the common goal is not present from the beginning; rather, the common goal emerges during the process of collaboration. Unfortunately, when the conflicting interests of different actors are at stake, the large majority of environmental multi-party efforts often do not reliably deliver sustainable improvements to policy and/or practice. One of the reasons for this, which has been long established by many case studies, is that social learning with a focus on relational practices is missing. The purpose of this paper is to present the design and initial results of a pilot study that utilized a game-based approach to explore the effects of relational practices on the effectiveness of water governance. This paper verifies the methods used by addressing the following question: are game mechanisms, protocols for facilitation and observation, the recording of decisions and results, and participant surveys adequate to reliably test hypotheses about behavioral decisions related to water governance? We used the ""Lords of the Valley"" (LOV) game, which focuses on the local-level management of a hypothetical river valley involving many stakeholders. We used an observation protocol to collect data on the quality of relational practices and compared this data with the quantitative outcomes achieved by participants in the game. In this pilot study, we ran the game three times with different groups of participants, and here we provide the outcomes within the context of verifying and improving the methods. © 2019 by the authors.","Experimental social research; Multi-party collaboration; Relational practices; River basin management; Serious games; Social learning; Social simulation; Stakeholders; Water governance","Decision making; Surveys; Water management; Multi-party collaboration; Relational practices; River basin management; Social learning; Social research; Social simulations; Stakeholders; Water governance; Serious games; decision making; governance approach; stakeholder; strategic approach; sustainable development; water management",,,,,"U.S. Geological Survey, USGS

The aims of this study were (1) to develop a participatory approach for identifying and evaluating management options for river basin climate adaptation and (2) to apply and evaluate the approach in four case-study river basins across the Mediterranean. As part of the approach, a diverse group of stakeholders joined a series of workshops and consultations in four river basins located in Cyprus, Slovenia, Spain and Tunisia. In each river basin, stakeholders expressed their views on challenges in their river basins, as well as options to tackle these challenges. We used the information on challenges, as well as the factors contributing to these challenges to develop a fuzzy cognitive map for each basin. These maps were converted into mathematical models and were used to assess the impact of a total of 102 suggested management options for the four river basins. We linked the options and their estimated impacts with a multi-criteria analysis to identify the most preferred options. The approach was positively evaluated by the participating stakeholders and allowed the link of stakeholders' knowledge and perceptions about their river basin with their preferences for options to adapt the management of their river basins to future conditions. © 2017 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Fuzzy cognitive mapping; Multi-criteria analysis; Participation; River basin; Water management","Cognitive systems; Rivers; Water management; Watersheds; Adaptation; Fuzzy cognitive mappings; Multi Criteria Analysis; Participation; River basins; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; fuzzy mathematics; Mediterranean environment; multicriteria analysis; participatory approach; perception; river basin; stakeholder; water availability; water management; Cyprus; Slovenia; Spain; Tunisia",,,,,"National Environmental Engineering Research Institute

The objective of this paper is to present a methodology for feasibility studies on water neutrality for the food processing industry in Flanders (Belgium). In 2010 a total amount of ca. 46 10 6 m 3 water was used in the Flemish food processing industry of which 68% consisted of ground water. Based on a mass balance of water, scientific data, the Flemish Input Output model and a participative process with stakeholders, an overall concept of water neutrality in the Flemish food processing industry was developed. The method consists of three steps. - defining the concept of water neutrality in the context of the Flemish food processing industry;- defining measures for reducing the impact of the Flemish food processing industry on their water use and determine the reduction potential for those measures, taking into account the implementing risks;- translating the measures into a roadmap for the next twenty years and verifying if the measures are sufficient to turn over the actual Flemish food industry into a water neutral one.By defining and applying the water neutrality concept in this feasibility study for the Flemish food processing industry, it can be concluded that it will be hard for the industry to become water neutral by 2030, but the developed roadmap shows how the industry can become more sustainable by 2030 and take significant steps. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Food processing industry; Input output model; Stakeholder participation; Water footprint; Water neutrality","Groundwater; Planning; Processed foods; Risk assessment; Water conservation; Water resources; Feasibility studies; Food industries; Food processing industry; Impact on the environment; Input output model; Reduction potential; Stakeholder participation; Water footprint; Food processing",,,,,"Vlaamse regering","This research was supported by the Environment, Nature and Energy Department (Unit of Environmental Integration and Subsidisation) of the Flemish Government .

Five case studies have been considered, located in the River Basin Districts of the Po river (Italy), Scotland (United Kingdom), Scheldt river (Belgium), Danube river (Romania), Sado and Mira rivers and Ribeiras do Algarve (Portugal). These cases represent different regional contexts of application of this EU water policy, with specific socio-economic drivers and environmental issues. Each case study has developed an operational framework to analyse ecosystem services in practice together with a group of local stakeholders. In each regional case, we examined how EU water policy and RBMPs are implemented, considered legal and planning instruments from the national to the local scale, and we analysed the use of ecosystem service terms and concepts in the relevant planning instruments. In parallel, we explored the view of local stakeholders and water managers on the topic, collecting their opinion on three major aspects: the usefulness of the concepts and approaches of ecosystem services for WFD river basin management plans, the risks and benefits of their use, and the knowledge needs to put the concepts into practice. The major drawback of the ecosystem service approach seems to be the challenge for practitioners of understanding new concepts and methodologies, while the major advantages are that it highlights all the hidden benefits of a water body in good health and promotes multi-functionality and sustainability in water management. The results of this study provide a picture across Europe of the current use of the concepts of ecosystem services in the RBMP and relevant insight on the opinion of local stakeholders and water managers. © 2016 The Author(s)","Ecosystem services; Project OpenNESS; River Basin Management Plan; Stakeholders; Water framework directive","ground water; nitric acid derivative; surface water; agriculture; Article; Belgium; catchment; ecosystem; environmental planning; Europe; fluid balance; human; information processing; Italy; Portugal; priority journal; quantitative analysis; risk management; river basin; Romania; Scotland; United Kingdom; waste water management; water management; water pollution; water supply",,,,,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia

Citizen involvement is thought to stimulate bottom-up accountability and broaden the information base, which may enrich design and implementation processes and foster improved water accessibility and sustainability. Practices on the ground, however, are embedded in socio-political realities which mediate possible beneficial effects of participatory approaches. This paper builds on full social network data collected in a Ugandan village to study the social and political reality of two distinct levels of participation, i.e. local information sharing among citizens and a more active appeal to fellow citizens to improve water services. We use Logistic Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure to explore what type of actor and network traits influence information sharing and whether the same factors are in play in the demand for action to remedy water-related problems. Whereas social aspects (social support relations) and homophily (using the same water source, the same gender) play an important role in information sharing, it is the educational level, in particular, of the villager who is called upon that is important when villagers demand action. Our findings also demonstrate that those most in need of safe water do not mobilize their information sharing ties to demand for action. This indicates that building local water policies and practice exclusively on locally existing demand for action may fail to capture the needs of the most deprived citizens. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Demand for action; Information sharing; Social network analysis; Uganda; Water","Information analysis; Information dissemination; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Water; Water management; Water resources; Demand for action; Design and implementations; Information sharing; Local information sharing; National Water Policy; Participatory approach; Uganda; Water-related problems; Rural areas; water; bottom-up approach; data acquisition; local participation; policy implementation; social network; sustainability; water demand; water planning; Article; human; information processing; rural population; social network; social support; sociology; Ugandan; water supply; environmental policy; environmental protection; information dissemination; rural population; standards; supply and distribution; trends; Uganda; Uganda; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Humans; Information Dissemination; Rural Population; Social Support; Uganda; Water Resources; Water Supply",,"water, 7732-18-5",,,,,,,,"Andersson, K., van Laerhoven, F., From local strongman to facilitator. institutional incentives for participatory municipal governance in Latin America (2013) Comp Polit Stud, 40, pp. 1085-1109; Baumann, E., Do operation and maintenance pay?

However, social studies of science and technology - also for the nuclear domain - emphasize that 'the social' and 'the technical' dimensions of technology development are inter-related and co-produced. In an effort to create links between nuclear research and innovation and society in mutually beneficial ways, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre started fifteen years ago a 'Programme of Integration of Social Aspects into nuclear research' (PISA). In line with broader science-policy agendas (responsible research and innovation and technology assessment), this paper argues that the importance of such programmes is threefold. First, their multi-disciplinary basis and participatory character contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between science, technology and society, in general, and the complexity of nuclear technology assessment in particular. Second, their functioning as (self -)critical policy supportive research with outreach to society is an essential prerequisite for policies aiming at generating societal trust in the context of controversial issues related to nuclear technologies and exposure to ionising radiation. Third, such programmes create an enriching dynamic in the organisation itself, stimulating collective learning and transdisciplinarity. The paper illustrates with concrete examples these claims and concludes by discussing some key challenges that researchers face while engaging in work of this kind. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Multi-disciplinary research; Nuclear research; Science and technology studies","Ionizing radiation; Social aspects; Social sciences; Collective learning; Innovation and technology; Multi-disciplinary research; Nuclear research; Science and Technology; Science and technology studies; Technology development; Transdisciplinarity; Nuclear engineering; human geography; integrated approach; interdisciplinary approach; learning; nuclear power; participatory approach; policy development; research work; science and technology; technological change; Article; compensation; emergency; ethics; human; humanities; independence; interdisciplinary research; interpersonal communication; knowledge; management; nanotechnology; nuclear energy; nuclear industry; perception; planning; population group; radiation hazard; radioactive waste; safety; science; scientist; social media; sociology; trust; waste management; Belgium; nuclear energy; research; trends; Belgium; Humanities; Nuclear Energy; Research; Social Sciences",,,,,,"A key challenge for research programmes such as PISA is their independence and credibility. While performing research from out of a ‘neutral’ university environment may not necessarily guarantee independence and credibility as such, one can reasonably expect scepticism with respect to the independence and credibility of critical-reflective research on nuclear technology done from out of (and sponsored by) a nuclear research centre. The previous considerations on PISA research activities show that this research is done with a continuous awareness of its being located within a nuclear research centre, but that is obviously not enough. More important perhaps is that PISA researchers increasingly receive invitations to take up an advisory role on nuclear-related policies at the science-policy interface. Key examples include a study on the history of the societal debate on nuclear energy ( Laes et al., 2007 ) for the Flemish Institute for Science and Technology Assessment, a contribution on ‘Ethics of Nuclear Energy’ in the Science Policy Commission of the Belgian Parliament, the participation to the European Interdisciplinary Study on ‘Benefits and Limitations of Nuclear Fission for a Low Carbon Economy’ ( European Economic and Social Committee, 2012 ) and the chairing of the advisory expert committee on options for the national nuclear fuel cycle, undertaken by the Belgian Federal Public Service Economy, SMEs, Self-Employed and Energy. While these examples obviously do not prove PISA's independence, they may be understood as a sign that its input is valued and increasingly called for at the policy level. 7.2",,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organ.

Climate change is predicted to raise temperatures in the Mediterranean region and reduce rainfall, leading to a reduction in water yield and possibly worsening the situation of water resource shortages that Mediterranean regions are already experiencing. In its dissemination strategy, the EU FP7 CLIMB project addressed water security threats through an analysis of water uses and water use rivalries within a few target catchments distributed over the Mediterranean region. The present work explores whether climate change is locally perceived by stakeholders (water users and managers) as a key issue for their water uses and water security. Individual interviews, meetings, and compilation of questionnaires were conducted at five sites located in the Mediterranean region. The methodology permitted an analysis of water use and its evolution in the water management context, an identification of the state of awareness of local stakeholders and of the pressures on water use and water use rivalries, and a prioritization of water uses. Currently, the main response to increasing water demand in the Mediterranean region, while not yet considering climate change as a driving force, is a progressive externalization of water resources, with limits represented by national borders and technological possibilities. Overall, 'climate change' was not mentioned by stakeholders during both interviews and in answers to the questionnaires. Even the prospect of decreasing precipitation was not considered a relevant or threatening issue in the coming 20 years. This confirms the need to continue all efforts to disseminate the state of knowledge on climate change impacts in the Mediterranean region, such as water scarcity, especially to local water managers, as initiated by various research programs of the European Commission. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Mediterranean region; Rivalries; Stakeholders; Water uses","Catchments; Managers; Mobile security; Surveys; Water management; Water resources; Water supply; Climate change impact; European Commission; Mediterranean region; Research programs; Resource shortage; Rivalries; Stakeholders; Water use; Climate change; rain; climate change; European Commission; questionnaire survey; research program; resource scarcity; stakeholder; water demand; water management; water use; Article; case study; catchment; climate change; controlled study; priority journal; questionnaire; Southern Europe; water analysis; water management; water supply; water use; Mediterranean Region",,,,,"244151","This paper was funded by the European Commission Seventh Framework Program through the CLIMB project, grant number 244151 .

In this research, a serious game on water management is used where participants receive feedback on consequences of their choices from an Integrated Assessment Meta Model. This study aims to determine if and how social learning takes place and explores the role of the model in social learning. Group discussions were qualitatively analysed to uncover and understand the mechanisms in this process. Results show that social learning took place in 10 of the 12 game sessions. Though model feedback was an important driver for social learning, social learning was driven most by the team's reflection on their perspective. We conclude that using a model can facilitate social learning in a serious-game setting, in particular in combination with reflection on teams' perspectives. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Serious game; Simulation model; Social learning; Water management","Natural resources management; Water management; Complex problems; Group discussions; Integrated assessment; Natural resource management; Serious games; Simulation model; Social learning; Solution process; Computer resource management; computer simulation; environmental modeling; learning; participatory approach; perception; social development; software; water management",,,,,,,,,,"Akkerman, S., Admiraal, W., Brekelmans, M., Oost, H., Auditing quality of research in social sciences (2008) Qual.

However, challenges related to implementation of these schemes are often underestimated. Any guarantee that a payment will secure or provide such a service is subject not only to underlying ecological uncertainties but also to those entailed by the kinds of social interaction that are inherent to policy implementation. It is argued that the objectives proposed with these instruments can only be attained by ensuring a wide participation of land users. This article advances this topic reporting and discussing evidence on farmer's reasons to participate in three PES-water schemes in Brazil using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research approaches. Results indicate that the diverging opinions regarding how ecosystem services are generated or secured, decentralized governance structures and the involvement of representative bodies in scheme design and implementation are important factors to consider. Furthermore, access to information and general environmental concern were found to be important variables to explain the propensity of farmers to participate. This generates serious policy implications for developing consistent communication and consultation strategies with scheme beneficiaries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; Environmental policy; Participation; Payments for Ecosystem Services; Water governance","economic instrument; ecosystem service; environmental policy; farmers attitude; governance approach; incentive; local participation; policy making; water management; Brazil",,,,,,,,,,"Arriagada, R.A., Sills, E.O., Pattanayak, S.K., Ferraro, P.J., Combining qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate participation in Costa Rica's program of payments for environmental services (2009) J.

Systems are also facing problems of underuse, poor maintenance and inadequate cost recovery. This study reports about approaches used by water and sanitation program implementers in Shebedino District, a rural area in Ethiopia. A community-based study was conducted using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a structured questionnaire. A total of 635 households were studied. The supplier-induced approach was found to be the main approach used by program implementers. The involvement of beneficiary communities at different stages of the projects was limited. Water and sanitation services were subsidized by implementing agencies but households were dissatisfied with the outcomes. More than 88 % of respondents stated that they did not have any relevant skills or expertise to enable them to maintain the facilities. Logistic regression analysis results showed that approaches used by sanitation program implementers were statistically associated with sex of household heads (2.144, AOR 95 % Cl: 1. 520-3.025), family size (1.554, AOR 95 % CI: 1.100-2.196), subsidy (1.699, AOR 95 % CI: 0.390-0.921) and occupation (15.196, AOR 95 % CI: 1.946-118.660). However, no statistical significant association was found among age, sex, marital status, income, family size, education and occupation and approaches used by water program implementers. Generally, the unsatisfactory results of the supplier-induced approach (80.8 % for water and 33.1 % for sanitation facilities) point out the need for program implementers to give more attention to the demands and preferences of users. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Community participation; Demand-driven approach; Ethiopia; Supply-driven approach; Water and sanitation programs","Community participation; Cost recovery; Demand-driven approach; Ethiopia; Focus groups; In-depth interviews; Logistic regression analysis; Sanitation services; Sanitation systems; Supply-driven approach; Depreciation; Regression analysis; Rural areas; Water supply; Sanitation; local participation; logistics; occupation; regression analysis; rural area; sanitation; subsidy system; water supply; Ethiopia",,,,,,,,,,"Abaire, B., (2004) CRS Experience on Water Supply and Sanitation, , Addis Ababa: Catholic Relief Servics Ethiopia Program; Admassu, M., Kumie, A., Fantahun, M., Sustainability of drinking water supply projects in rural North Gondar, Ethiopia (2003) Ejhd, 17, pp. 221-229; (2005) Gender Guidelines, , Australian Government.

This governance model of democracy promotion has so far been studied only with regard to its effectiveness in target countries. In contrast to earlier research, this contribution takes an 'input' perspective and asks whether adverse sectoral economic interests prevent the EU from consistent democratic governance promotion. Based on three case studies from the two policy sectors of environmental and fisheries policy, the contribution concludes that EU democratic governance promotion is indeed inconsistent when sectoral economic interests are at stake. The governance model is thus subject to the same pattern of inconsistency as the leverage and linkage model with regard to economic interests.© 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Common fisheries policy; Democracy promotion; Democratic governance; European neighbourhood policy; European union; Fisheries partnership agreements; Functional cooperation; Genetically modified organisms; Public participation; Water governance",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung","The Commission’s approach was subsequently supported by the Council.3","The research for this contribution has been undertaken within the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Democracy.

During the past decade, reform-oriented institutions, such as water user associations and contracting, have largely replaced the traditional institution of collective management in village-level irrigation systems. A feature unique to China is that water user associations and contractors are provided with monetary incentives to save water. Water user associations have not yet achieved the broad-based participation of farmers that some advocates consider as a primary goal for forming the associations. Many village leaders serve also as the leaders of water user associations, thus possibly reducing opportunities for receiving operational input and policy direction from farmers. However, we observe improved performance of irrigation systems managed by water user associations, relative to collective management, in terms of maintenance expenditures, the timeliness of water deliveries, and the rates of fee collection. Performance has improved also in systems managed by contractors, although not as substantially as in the case of water user associations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Collective management; Contracting; Incentives; Irrigation system performance; Participation; Water user associations","Collective management; Contracting; Incentives; Irrigation system performance; Participation; Water user associations; Contractors; Irrigation; Management; Transportation personnel; Water management; Water supply; Water conservation; empirical analysis; incentive; irrigation system; local participation; water economics; water management; China",,,,,,,,,,"Benjamin, D., Brandt, L., Giles, J., The evolution of income inequality in rural China (2005) Econ.

In particular, the ways in which the objects presented by the user interfaces to the different classes of stakeholders become transmuted into symbols In the minds of these stakeholders through the active exercise of their Imaginations are exemplified and further analysed. This work has proceeded concurrently with the design, writing and development of the software necessary to realise its aims and ambitions, with special attention being given to the new kinds of user Interfaces and viewing facilities that are then required. This work will be described separately by other authors involved in this initiative. It is emphasised at various junctures that enterprises of this kind carry substantial risks and must be approached with much care and understanding; and indeed the primary reason for writing this paper Is to communicate not only the risks, but also the corresponding level of understanding that is necessary to overcome these risks. © IWA Publishing 2010 Journal of Hydroinformatics.","Numerical modelling; Social justice; Software as a service; Stakeholder participation",,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, M.B., (1991) Hydroinformatics: Information Technology and the Aquatic Environment, , Avebury, Aldershot, UK and Brookfield, USA; Abbott, M.B., The gender issue in hydroinformatics, or orpheus in the underworld (2000) J.

The thesis is advanced that the judgement that is so passed is a recognition on the part of the stakeholders of a realisation of social justice. This paper is thus given over in its first part to an analysis of the origins and the nature of social justice in this sector. It is emphasised that, although the resources of hydroinformatics in this endeavour are largely based upon quantitative assessments, the ways in which these translate through stakeholder participation into experiences of social justice are essentially qualitative. Thus, although we are currently concerned for the most part with a hydroinformatics of the quantities, this now has to be extended into a hydroinformatics of the qualities. © IWA Publishing 2010.","Numerical modelling; Social justice; Software as a service; Stakeholder participation",,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, M.B., (1991) Hydroinformatics: Information Technology and the Aquatic Environment, , Avebury Technical, Aldershot/ Brookfield, VT; Abbott, M.B., Forchheimer and Schoklitsch: A postmodern retrospection (1999) Memorial Symposium P.

Sea and rainwater regularly floods many of its low-lying neighbourhoods, with rainwater advancing down the deforested hill slopes too fast, resulting in stagnant bodies of water, such as rivers and drains, being full of polluted water. Potable water is in short supply, having to cope with an ill-maintained network that barely reaches 20 percent of the population. Over 30 years of political instability, neglect or mismanagement of infrastructure, occasional (international) exploitative practices, and a rapidly increasing population, have all contributed to the seemingly insurmountable problems the city is facing today. The NGO consortium of Oxfam-UK, PROTOS and GTIH took the challenge in June 2006 when they joined efforts for a water and sanitation project, in cooperation with local authorities, regional and national agencies, and with the financial support of the European Commission and Belgian Government. By mid-2008, this project can already show a few achievements, however, its ambition is far-reaching, namely, how transform a water-problem city into a water-opportunity city, and how to use proper water governance as leverage for social and institutional development. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group.","Basic infrastructure; Capacity building; Participation; Strategic plan; Urban flooding; Water challenge","Basic infrastructure; Capacity building; Participation; Strategic plan; Urban flooding; Strategic planning; Water pollution; Potable water",,,,,,,,,,"(2007) Rapport Bref de la Première Mission, Partie II: Conclusions et Observations -Premier Tour D'horizon, , Centre Human Settlements (CHS), unpublished mission report; (2007) Rapport Final de la Deuxième Mission: Compte Rendu et éValuation de l'atelier Animé Par le CHS, , Centre Human Settlements (CHS), unpublished mission report; (1997) Etudes D'Urbanisme à Cap-Haitien, 1. , Dessau International Ltd., Dossier Fondamental, Agence canadienne de développement international; Dolisca, F., McDaniel, J.M., Teeter, L.D., Jolly, C.M., Land tenure, population pressure, and deforestation in Haiti: The case of Forêt des Pins Reserve (2007) Journal of Forest Economics, 13 (4), pp. 277-289. , DOI 10.1016/j.jfe.2007.02.006, PII S1104689907000207; Gregoire, T., (2000) Haïti: Partir de la Base, pp. 5-7. , Courier ACP-EU no.178; Hamdi, N., (2004) Small Change: About the Art of Practice and the Limits of Planning in Cities, , Earthscan; Joseph, M., (2008) Fort St. Michel ou la Cité Soleil Du Cap-Haitien!, , Le Matin Haiti; Kaupp, R., (2006) Sanitation in Urban and Peri-urban Areas of Cap-Haitien: The Promotion of Different Latrine Options through a Social Marketing Approach, , University of Southampton, unpublished dissertation; (2006) Réhabilitation et/ou Construction de Systèmes d'Adduction d'eau Potable Dans Le Nord Lot 2, , LGL-SA, Union Européenne, Republique d'Haiti, Ville du Cap-Haitien.

Uzbekistan is in the throes of change and facing a huge restructuring task and a need to improve governance. Decades of central bureaucratic allocation of natural resources left national bureaucrats with little capacity to formulate their own sustainable policies. Lack of inclusive, long term oriented policies and mechanisms in management of common pool resources brought catastrophic results in the past. The study reveals that implanting a top-down quota policy has positive effects on a larger public.

The FMIS generally outperform the modern irrigation systems constructed and operated by the government agencies with regard to the water delivery effectiveness, agricultural productivity etc., and the presence of a sound organization responsible to run the FMIS, often referred to as the 'social capital', is the key to this success. This paper studies another important aspect residing in the FMIS: potentials to expand the irrigation area by means of their proper rehabilitation and modernization. Taking the case study of the Babai Irrigation Project in Nepal, it is demonstrated that the flow, which in the past was used to irrigate the 5400 ha area covered by three FMIS, can provide irrigation to an additional 8100 ha in the summer, 4180 ha vegetables in the winter and 1100 ha maize in the spring season after the FMIS rehabilitation. The ""priority water rights"" of the FMIS part have been evaluated based on relevant crop water requirement calculations and is found to be equal to 85.4 million m3 per year. Consequently, the dry season irrigation strategy at the extension area could be worked out based on the remaining flow. By storing the surplus discharge of the monsoon and autumn in local ponds, and by consuming them in dry period combined with nominal partial irrigation practice, wheat and mustard can be cultivated over about 4000 ha of the extension area. Furthermore, storage and surface irrigation both contribute to the groundwater recharge. The conjunctive use of ground, surface and harvested water might be the mainstream in the future for a sustainable irrigation water management in the region. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Implementing IWRM requires cooperation between policy sectors, countries, government bodies, the civic sector and scientific disciplines. The social learning approach suggests several ingredients for such cooperation. First, water managers and the other stakeholders need to realize their dependence on each other. Second, they need to start interacting, share their problem perceptions and develop different potential solutions. This requires the development of mutual trust, recognition of diversity and critical self-reflection. Finally, the stakeholders need to make joint decisions and arrangements for implementation. Often, an external facilitator can be helpful. The social learning approach to IWRM has several implications for the IWRM ToolBox of the GWP. Social learning is not a magic solution for all problems, but there is sufficient evidence that it can work. © 2008 International Water Resources Association.","Cooperation; Integrated water resources management; Social learning; Transboundary",,,,,,"European Commission: EVK1-CT-2002-00120","The work of the HarmoniCOP project presented in this paper has been financially supported by the European Commission under the contract number EVK1-CT-2002-00120.",,,,"Argyris, C., Schon, D., (1996) Organizational Learning II.

Adequate water allocation needs informed decisions to meet increasing socio-economic demands while respecting the environmental integrity of this basin. Key players in the Andarax water sector include the municipality of Almeria, the irrigators involved in the intensive greenhouse agricultural sector, and booming second residences. A decision support system (DSS) is developed to rank different sustainable planning and management alternatives according to their socio-economic and environmental performance. The DSS is intimately linked to sustainability indicators and is designed through a public participation process. Indicators are linked to criteria reflecting stakeholders concerns in the 2005 field survey, such as fulfilling water demand, water price, technical and economical efficiency, social and environmental impacts. Indicators can be partly quantified after simulating the operation of the groundwater reservoir over a 20-year planning period and partly through a parallel expert evaluation process. To predict the impact of future water demand in the catchment, several development scenarios are designed to be evaluated in the DSS. The successive multi-criteria analysis of the performance indicators permits the ranking of the different management alternatives according to the multiple objectives formulated by the different sectors/participants. This allows more informed and transparent decision-making processes for the Andarax river basin, recognizing both the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of water resources management. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Decision support; Multi-criteria analysis; Stakeholder involvement; Sustainability indicators; Water management","Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Problem solving; Water management; Stakeholder involvement; Sustainability indicators; Decision support systems; catchment; decision making; decision support system; local participation; resource allocation; river basin; stakeholder; sustainable development; water demand; water economics; water management; Almeria [Andalucia]; Andalucia; Andarax Basin; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain",,,,,"Ministry of Environment, MOE","• The National Hydrological Plan and the Hydrological Basin Plans, prepared by the Ministry of Environment and evaluated by the National/Andalusian Water Council;","Acknowledgements This work was undertaken in support of the EU ALERT project (contract no.

Based on the success of some indigenous irrigation schemes, it was assumed that farmers could easily become managers. As decision-making was the exclusive terrain of the governmental agencies that ran the schemes, farmers never gained the necessary experience with water management. Therefore, training of farmers and WUAs on the principles and processes of water management is essential. This paper demonstrates a practical example of training material on water management that incorporates research results on the process of Irrigation Management Transfer and resulting farmers' water management for the case of the Office du Niger irrigation scheme. The results of the paper explain how input from research was used in the four steps of the construction of training material. These steps are (1) setting the training agenda, (2) selecting and adapting information to be featured, (3) targeting the audience and (4) designing the actual training material. A first validation of the approach and examples of the actual training material were obtained in a workshop uniting all stakeholders. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Capacity building; Collective irrigation schemes; Irrigation management transfer; Mali; Water management","Decision making; Personnel training; Technical presentations; Water management; Collective irrigation scheme; Irrigation management transfer; Irrigation; Decision making; Irrigation; Personnel training; Technical presentations; Water management; capacity building; decision making; indigenous knowledge; irrigation system; stakeholder; water management; water use; Africa; Mali; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",,,,,"IWT","Acknowledgement The research was supported financially by a grant from the Flemish Institute for the Encouragement of Scientific and Technological Research (IWT) to Klaartje Vandersypen.",,,,"(2004) Analyse Économique De La Filière Riz Au Mali, , AFD AFD, Bamako, Mali; Baland, J.-M., Platteau, J.-P., Coordination problems in local-level resource management (1997) J Dev Econ, 53, pp. 197-210; Bastiaens, L., Perceptie van boeren op het waterbeheer in geïrrigeerde rijstvelden langsheen de Niger in Mali (2005), Master dissertation.

Water resources management has a strong engineering tradition based on controlling environmental problems with technical solutions. The management of risks relied on the ability to predict extremes and limit their impact with technical means such as dikes, dams and reservoirs. In this paradigm, belief systems, human attitudes and collective behaviours are perceived as external boundary conditions and not as integral part of management. However, the situation has started to change dramatically. Over the past years, integrated water resources management has become the reigning paradigm. The importance of governance and cultural adaptation has become a major issue of concern. At the same time, there is a paucity of adequate scientific concepts that would allow addressing these issues. This paper introduces a concept for social learning developed in the European project HarmoniCOP and discusses its implications for the cultural and institutional context of water resources management. It aims to contribute to the new paradigm of integrated resource management by discussing the importance of processes of culture and social learning for environmental resources management, in general, and water resources management, in particular. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Diverse managing goals, changing environmental conditions, conflicting interests, and lack of predictability are some of the characteristics that decision makers have to face. This has resulted in the application and development of strategies such as adaptive management, which proposes flexibility and capability to adapt to unknown conditions as a way of dealing with uncertainties. However, this shift in ideas about managing has not always been accompanied by a general shift in the way uncertainties are understood and handled. To improve this situation, we believe it is necessary to recontextualize uncertainty in a broader way - relative to its role, meaning, and relationship with participants in decision making - because it is from this understanding that problems and solutions emerge. Under this view, solutions do not exclusively consist of eliminating or reducing uncertainty, but of reframing the problems as such so that they convey a different meaning. To this end, we propose a relational approach to uncertainty analysis. Here, we elaborate on this new conceptualization of uncertainty, and indicate some implications of this view for strategies for dealing with uncertainty in water management. We present an example as an illustration of these concepts.","Adaptive management; Ambiguity; Frames; Framing; Knowledge relationship; Multipleknowledge frames; Natural resource management; Negotiation; Participation; Social learning; Uncertainty; Water management","adaptive management; conceptual framework; decision making; environmental conditions; knowledge; uncertainty analysis; water management",,,,,,,,,,"Ackoff, R.L., Beyond prediction and preparation (1983) Journal of Management Studies, 20, pp. 59-69; Argyris, C., Schön, D., (1978) Organizational Learning: A theory of action perspective, , Addison Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, USA; Beck, B., Model evaluation and performance (2002) Encyclopedia of environmetrics, three, pp. 1275-1279. , A.H.

In this context, the HarmoniCOP project studies ways to improve PP based on the concept of Social Learning (SL). SL refers to the growing capacity of a social network to develop and perform collective actions. Complex issues such as RBM can be better resolved taking into account the diversity of interests and mental frames, and relying on disseminated information and knowledge. Information and Communication tools (IC-tools) can thereby play an important role. In this paper we firstly present our main concepts in relation to SL and PP. Then we propose a provisional qualitative characterisation of the role of IC-tools. Thirdly, we present a framework of analysis to explore IC-tool impact on participatory and SL processes. This framework is used to assess the IC-tools from three perspectives: their technical characteristics, their impact on PP and SL and their usability as perceived by the users. In the fourth part we present a first application of the framework of analysis for two case studies in Flanders and in Dordogne (France). Finally, we discuss some expected future outcomes of the project. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Management practices have largely been developed and implemented by experts using technical means based on designing systems that can be predicted and controlled. In recent years, stakeholder involvement has gained increasing importance. Collaborative governance is considered to be more appropriate for integrated and adaptive management regimes needed to cope with the complexity of social-ecological systems. The paper presents a concept for social learning and collaborative governance developed in the European project HarmoniCOP (Harmonizing COllaborative Planning). The concept is rooted in the more interpretive strands of the social sciences emphasizing the context-dependence of knowledge. The role of frames and boundary management in processes of learning at different levels and time scales is investigated. The foundation of social learning as investigated in the HarmoniCOP project is multiparty collaboration processes that are perceived to be the nuclei of learning processes. Such processes take place in networks or ""communities of practice"" and are influenced by the governance structure in which they are embedded. Requirements for social learning include institutional settings that guarantee some degree of stability and certainty without being rigid and inflexible. Our analyses, which are based on conceptual considerations and empirical insights, suggest that the development of such institutional settings involves continued processes of social learning. In these processes, stakeholders at different scales are connected in flexible networks that allow them to develop the capacity and trust they need to collaborate in a wide range of formal and informal relationships ranging from formal legal structures and contracts to informal, voluntary agreements.

This application is not limited to a simple transposition of the Walloon model. The Burkina context calls for adaptation to the local environmental and socio-economical realities with an adequate partnership management. The importance of the mobilization around this project of institutional partners, as well as local collectivities, agricultural producers and water users in general reveals the great expectations of the actors concerning this new tool of water participative management. But will the latter be equal to the task? A first assessment has been drawn up one year after the launch. During the first year of the project, a participative diagnostic was implemented but the understanding of basic notions of water management such as 'river' (not translatable in the local language), 'watershed', 'contract' were not obvious. After the identification of functions and uses of water in the basin, an environmental survey was started. This approach allows study with the river committees of the priority actions to be developed as a first project of restoration of the gallery forest alongside the stream to fight against desertification. This project of integrated and participative management of water at sub-basin level is a concrete example of solidarity and exchange know-how between North and South in the context of a sustainable development. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Burkina Faso; Participative management; Sourou; Walloon region; Water","Catchments; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Management; Restoration; Stream flow; Sustainable development; Water resources; Watersheds; Desertification; Participative management; River contract; Walloon region; Water management; Rivers; Catchments; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Management; Restoration; Rivers; Stream flow; Sustainable development; Water resources; Watersheds; participatory approach; partnership approach; river management; water management; article; Belgium; contract; controlled study; desertification; ecosystem restoration; environmental factor; forest management; geography; socioeconomics; sustainable development; water management; Agriculture; Belgium; Burkina Faso; Conservation of Natural Resources; International Cooperation; Models, Theoretical; Rivers; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Belgium; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Wallonia; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Social charter for water, a new approach to water management in the 21st century (2000), p. 287. , Académie de l'eau Water Agencies, Académie de l'eau, World Water Vision; Bado Sama, H., Yéyé, S., Le « contrat des rivières » peut-il contribuer à mieux gérer l'environnement burkinabé?

Regional algorithms designed for Belgian waters have been implemented and compared with the standard MERIS products, termed Total Suspended Matter and Algal2 respectively. The standard and regional SPM products seem robust and give similar data. Notwithstanding a more complete match-up validation analysis, these products seem sufficiently mature for use in applications such as sediment transport model validation. Results for CHL products are less convincing and further analysis is required before this data can be reliably used. In particular the MERIS Product Confidence flags have not yet been validated. The red and near infrared bands are particularly important in turbid coastal waters and should be considered a priority for further validation. MERIS full resolution mode is attractive for SPM mapping when compared with other sensors. For CHL mapping in coastal waters the superior spectral resolution and algorithm design give MERIS a distinct advantage over other ocean colour sensors. The disadvantages of MERIS, particularly for SPM mapping, are the reduced frequency (related to swath and sunglint) and availability of data.",,"Algorithms; Data reduction; Frequencies; Mapping; Particles (particulate matter); Reliability; Satellites; Coastal waters; MERIS products; Satellite data supply; Suspended particulate matter; Remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,"Fettweis, M., Van Den Eynde, D., The mud deposits and the high turbidity in the Belgian-Dutch coastal zone, Southern Bight of the North Sea (2003) Continental Shelf Research, 23, pp. 669-691; Stumpf, R.P., Pennock, J.R., Calibration of a general optical equation for remote sensing of suspended sediments in a moderately turbid estuary (1989) Journal of Geophysical Research, 94 (10), pp. 14363-14371; Roozekrans, J.N., Prangsma, G.J., Processing and application of digital AVHRR imagery for land- and sea-surfaces (1988) KNMI Beleidscommissie Remote Sensing (BCRS) Report, TO-3.1; Woerd, H.J.V.D., Towards an operational monitoring system for turbid waters (2000) Institute for Environmental Studies IVM Report, O-00-16; Ruddick, K.G., Optical remote sensing in support of eutrophication monitoring in Belgian waters (1999) 18th EARSEL Symposium on Operational Remote Sensing for Sustainable Development, pp. 445-452. , G.J.A.

Despite the importance given to community participation, successful experiences are limited in number, scope and duration. Experts are confronted with the paradox that they exclude local communities with the strategies and languages they use to include them. This study is based on the long-term experiences of the authors with a multi-actor initiative in southern Ecuador on sustainable rural drinking water management. They were involved as action-researchers, facilitating multiparty interactions and supporting reflective practice among the participants. The article shows how multiparty processes construct identities, workforms, structures and activities that cross the boundaries between communities of expert and indigenous practice, even in the exceptionally unequal conditions of the Andes, where inequalities between these communities are deeply rooted in history. Such transitions were taken as opportunities to look for common ground between different communities-of-practice whilst, at the same time, contradictions could come to the fore. As inequalities tend to be confirmed through interactions, not only inside but also outside the multi-actor initiative, they cannot be resolved definitively by a multiparty project. Under those circumstances a social constructionist approach, calling the attention to the constructed nature of mutual perceptions and relationships, was highly inspiring for the authors-facilitators to keep the reflection and dialogue among the participants in the process going-on.

This project aimed, in its social science component, at stimulating and studying processes of reflexive social learning and of participation and negotiation on local water management issues and on project activities. In this article we intend to show how specific project-related strategies and attempts towards facilitating participation fail and how other initiatives seem to succeed or at least to elicit valuable processes of negotiation and learning. We start from the commonly held view on participation as committed to reverse or subvert power relations. However, our research experiences indicate that participation is always part of an operation of power, governing people to behave themselves in a particular determined way. From this Foucauldian governmental perspective, we are able to reconsider the success and failure of participatory approaches, not so much in terms of the effectiveness of their application, but rather in terms of the possibility to refuse 'participatory' government.

The purpose of the project is to provide a tool to improve the integrated management of water resources at the catchment scale, based on the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). This paper presents the methodology aspects of the project. The design of the MULINO_DSS is based on the European Environment Agency DPSIR framework of environmental cause-effect relationships. D represents the driving forces, P, the pressures on the environment caused by human activities, S, the state of the environment, I, the impact on the environment and R, the human activities and desirable societal responses. This DPSIR chain provides the end-user of the DSS with an integrated view of complex, interacting issues. The first step in the MULINO project has been the analysis of local decision networks and the identification of an end-user to whom the DSS will be delivered. The importance of this step is illustrated by the results of the analysis for the Belgian case study: the Walloon part of the Dyle river catchment. The design of the DSS is made more complicated in this catchment by the fragmented nature of water management decision making. However, to overcome this problem, the design of the DSS was targeted at the river contract (RC) of the catchment. The coordinator of the RC is a focal point for a range of end-users and stakeholders with responsibility for water management in this catchment. This organisational structure was originally put in place to find a consensus when solving conflicting water management issues. Thus, the concept for the DSS development and delivery fits with the participatory approach principle of the WFD and builds on existing local networks of integrated water management. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
